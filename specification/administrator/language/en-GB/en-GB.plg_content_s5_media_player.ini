PLG_S5_MEDIA_PLAYER_XML_DESCRIPTION="<br /><strong>S5 Media Player Plugin Instructions</strong><br /><br /><strong>Credits:</strong><br /><br />Based on Media Element (<a href="http://mediaelementjs.com" title="Homepage of Media Element.JS" target="_blank">http://mediaelementjs.com</a>)<br />Previous Joomla 1.5 work by Phil Banks (<a href="https://github.com/emirpprime/mediael" target="_blank">https://github.com/emirpprime/mediael</a>)<br />Current additions provided by (<a href="http://www.shape5.com" target="_blank">http://www.shape5.com</a>)<br /><br /><strong>Description:</strong><br /><br />Content Plugin which provides a HTML5 video and audio player for Joomla!<br /><br /><strong>Syntax:</strong><br /><br />
In the backend of the plugin you set default options such as height, width, control settings, loading settings, etc. These options are default to all players on the whole site unless, and do not need to be redefined on the player. If you want to have a particular player with its own settings, then you would specify those calls on that individual player call. For example in the plugin's backend say you have set the default volume to be 0.8, but on a particular player you want it lower, you would enter the tag defaultVolume=[0.5] on that player's call. Be sure to hover over each of the plugin's parameters to read specific instructions in the tooltip.

If a video cannot be played in a particular browser you can specify a fallback image or a flash file to show in its place. Modern browsers will support mp4 and mp3 files with no problems.
<br/><br/>
For video: MP4, M4V and MOV should be encoded as H264 - these can also be specified as the Flash fallback file. Silverlight will automatically use the same files.For audio: any of the listed formats can be used for the Flash file."
